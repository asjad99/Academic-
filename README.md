#Project Description

DCT compression methods can introduce visible
artifacts at block boundaries of images. In this project we
take a look at an algorithm proposed by Luo and Ward
for the removal of edges of the blocks in regions that are
affected by blockiness effects. The algorithm uses an
adaptive approach where it considers the local
information of the image before proceeding with the
modification of pixel values based on weighted average
of neighbouring blocks. Experiments show that the
algorithm can significantly reduce the visible blockiness
artifacts from the given images.
