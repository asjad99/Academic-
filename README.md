# Project Description

## Artifact Removal

DCT compression methods can introduce visible
artifacts at block boundaries of images. In this project we
take a look at an algorithm proposed by Luo and Ward
for the removal of edges of the blocks in regions that are
affected by blockiness effects. The algorithm uses an
adaptive approach where it considers the local
information of the image before proceeding with the
modification of pixel values based on weighted average
of neighbouring blocks. Experiments show that the
algorithm can significantly reduce the visible blockiness
artifacts from the given images.



## Image Segmentation 

The aim of our project is to create an algorithm to extract
a pedestrian path from the rest of the image. The target is
achieved by using image segmentation by K-means and
developing a code to implement it in matlab. The idea
was to differentiate the path from the rest of the image in
terms of colour as the rest of the objects are turned white
so that the path is differentiated. The experiments have
shown promising results although there is some room for
improvement. The quality of segmentation can be
improved by various techniques and will automatically
improve the detail in our output images as well.
